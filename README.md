The player is a child in a unknown location and his goal is
to find his path home.
The atmosphere is foggy/dazy/dark/shaky.
The map shoud be neighbourhood/forest, where it changes
everytime the player doesnt look at it.

As time goes the camera gets shaky and dazy, so that the player
should "heal" himself.
