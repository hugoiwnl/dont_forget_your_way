# Dont-forget-your-way
 
The player is a child in a unknown location and his goal is to find his path home. The atmosphere is foggy/dazy/dark/shaky. The map shoud be neighbourhood/forest, where it changes everytime the player doesnt look at it.

As time goes the camera gets shaky and dazy, so that the player should "heal" himself.
